# `man` the interface to the manuals

`man` is the system manual pager. Very useful to learn command line utilites and tools.

### How to use:

```
man x           # display the manual page for the item (program) x
man -f x        # lookup for man pages and print short description (sim. to whatis)
man -Hy x       # open the manual page for x in internet browser (y)
man -w x        # get the location of the man page of the item x
man -k x        # list man pages using x as regular expression
man -a x        # page sequentially all manual pages of x
man -I x        # to make man command case sensitive
```
