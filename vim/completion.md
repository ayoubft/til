# Completion

Given a lot of words you already written: horse, camel, cat, dog,...

Now when I type: c`<C-p>`, it will show me suggetions to auto-complete my word.
Cycle through these suggetions using `<C-n>` for next and `<C-p>` for previous.

* If there is only one similar word, `<C-p>` will complete it.
